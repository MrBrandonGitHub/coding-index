Callback Methods in Lighting Web Components(lwc)
1. constructor()
2. connectedCallback()
3. disconnectedCallback()
4. render()
5. renderedCallback()
6. errorCallback(error, stack)

(( element means tag. for example: lightning card, lightning input, lightning button, so on ))


 
1.) constructor()
This callback method called when the component created.
This method lifecycle flows from Parent to Child component.
You can access the host element with this.template.
we can’t access child elements in the component body because they don’t exist yet.

2.) connectedCallback()
This callback method called when the element is inserted into a document.
This method lifecycle flows from Parent to Child Component.
we can’t access child elements in the component body because they don’t exist yet.
You can access the host element with this.template.

3.) disconnectedCallback()
This callback method called when the element is removed from a document.
This method lifecycle flows from Parent to Child Component.
we can use disconnectedcallback function in child component only


4.) render()
This callback method used to conditionally rendering a template or importing a custom one, use render() to override standard rendering functionality. 
This function gets invoked after connectedCallback() and must return a valid HTML template.

5.) renderedCallback()
This Method called after every render of the component.
This callback method is specific to Lightning Web Components, it isn’t from the HTML custom elements specification.
This method flows from child to parent.

6.)  errorCallback(error, stack)
This method called when a descendant component throws an error in one of its callback.
 The error argument is a JavaScript native error object, and the stack argument is a string.
 This callback method is specific to Lightning Web Components, it isn’t from the HTML custom elements specification.



-----------------------

AÇIKLAMA: ternary operator
var xyz = 2>5 ? 'Hello' : 'Hi';

xyz adında bir variable
eğer 2, 5 den büyükse xyz = 'Hello';
eğer 2, 5 ten küçükse xyz = 'Hi';
syntax ==>  condition ? true : false;
